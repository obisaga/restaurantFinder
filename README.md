Restaurant Finder


To open the link the server side is needed:
https://github.com/obisaga/restaurantFinderServer

Run the npm run dev command in the terminal after downloading this repository (server side is not deployed).

The server side was built as I had complications fetching the API from the provided link from the frontend - there was an error about CORS. I researched and found out that this could be ommited with the use of Heroku but as I never did it before I decided to resolve the problem by fetching data from the backend and pass it to the frontend.


The requirements for this task were:
- fetch data about restaurants by providing postcode
- display names, cuisines, ratings and addresses of the restaurants
- show only first 10 restaurants per site

I was not sure how advanced should this website be so I decided to keep it simple and focus on meeting the requirements. I added some responsiveness, used some bootstrap elements. I am aware it is not perfect, but I am sure it meets all the instructions given.
